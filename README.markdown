Does it work?
This has been tested on Mac os Lion with Safari 5.1 and Firefox 6.0.
Since Torquebox'es websocket implementation doesn't support

      draft-ietf-hybi-thewebsocketprotocol-10

The example doesn't work in latest Chrome and Firefox.
When Torquebox is updated the examples should work in all browsers suporting

draft-ietf-hybi-thewebsocketprotocol-10 and -07.
